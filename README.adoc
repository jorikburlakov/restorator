# Restorator API
This is a simple REST service that provides a single RESTful endpoint protected by OAuth 2. This is example of my test task.

# Stack Technologies
The following projects are used in this sample app:

- Spring Boot
- Spring MVC
- Spring Security
- Spring Security OAuth
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- GSON
- Maven

# Build and Run

Create Database restorator from PgAdmin or Script. You can set up your data source setting in application.properties.

Maven:

mvn clean package spring-boot:run

IDEA or Eclipse 

mvn clean install

run Application.java

or run like WebApp

# Endpoints

# Usage

In order to access the protected admin resource, you must first request an access token via the OAuth handshake. Request OAuth authorization:

```
curl -X POST -vu clientapp:123456 http://localhost:8080/oauth/token -H "Accept: application/json" -d "password=aingeiR2&username=admin&grant_type=password&scope=read%20write&client_secret=123456&client_id=clientapp"
```

A successful authorization results in the following JSON response:

```
{
"access_token":"9f6141c6-f296-45cf-a11d-58255e17bd91",
"token_type":"bearer",
"refresh_token":"c2c8e625-e2e6-4bf3-be5b-5db629e14e1c","expires_in":43199,
"scope":"read write"
}
```

In order to access the protected user resource, you should registrate. 

```
curl -X POST  http://localhost:8080/registration -H "Accept: application/json" -d "{"name":"George","login":"alpha","password":"password1"}"
```

After that you should send request an access token via the OAuth handshake. Request OAuth authorization:

```
curl -X POST -vu clientapp:123456 http://localhost:8080/oauth/token -H "Accept: application/json" -d "password=password1&username=alpha&grant_type=password&scope=read%20write&client_secret=123456&client_id=clientapp"
```

or used example user

```
curl -X POST -vu clientapp:123456 http://localhost:8080/oauth/token -H "Accept: application/json" -d "password=aingeiR2&username=user&grant_type=password&scope=read%20write&client_secret=123456&client_id=clientapp"
```

A successful authorization results in the following JSON response:

```
{
"access_token":"bc096c33-4b94-4141-9ad3-85f00324ca7c",
"token_type":"bearer",
"refresh_token":"19ee17da-58a9-4a4a-91f8-1110336b102a",
"expires_in":43199,
"scope":"read write"
}
```
Use the access_token returned to make the authorized request to the protected endpoint:

#SSL

To configure the project to run on HTTPS as shown in Building REST services with Spring, enable the https profile. You can do this by uncommenting the appropriate line in the application.properties file of this project. This will change the server port to 8443. Modify the previous requests as in the following command.

```
curl -X POST -k -vu clientapp:123456 https://localhost:8443/oauth/token -H "Accept: application/json" -d "password=aingeiR2&username=admin&grant_type=password&scope=read%20write&client_secret=123456&client_id=clientapp"
```

The -k parameter is necessary to allow connections to SSL sites without valid certificates or the self signed certificate which is created for this project.
